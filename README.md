MateableCoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency. The Mateable Core 24.x software allows anyone to operate a node in the MateableCoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.

Mateable Core 24.x is the first multi-algorithm (5 algorithms) currency with proof of stake. These algorithms are scrypt, yescrypt, whirlpool, ghostrider and balloon. The proof of stake system is based on Particl's PoSv3 system.

For information about the default fees used on the MateableCoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

**Website:** [coin.mateable.com](https://coin.mateable.com) 

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with Mateable Core 24.x, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Mateable Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `mateable-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `mateable-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Such ports

Mateable Core 24.x by default uses port `6969` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `6966` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | 
| :------- | ------: | 
| P2P      |   6969 |   
| RPC      |   6966 |
